# File: frontend/src/main.jsx

## Overview
`main.jsx` is the entry point for the Vite-built React application.

## Key Responsibilities
- **Mounting**: Uses `createRoot` to mount the React application into the DOM element with the ID `root` (defined in `index.html`).
- **Rendering**: Renders the `App` component within `StrictMode` to help catch potential problems in the application.
- **Styling**: Imports the global CSS file (`index.css`).

## Role in the System
Bootstraps the React application and attaches it to the browser's DOM.
